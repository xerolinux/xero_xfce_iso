<h1 align="center">Why am I charging for FOSS stuff?</h1>

A lot of people complain about why I'm charging for stuff that are **FOSS**. Simple and straightforward answer, **`I'm Not`**.

I'm charging for the **time, work and efforts** I put in creating those amazing stuff **`for you`**.

#### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

> There are three ways to support my efforts:<br /><br />
> If you just want the ISO, join my Patreon, details below; OR help spread the word about XeroLinux by talking about it; OR help test, send detailed feedback, troubleshoot, or otherwise help contribute towards my project and vision.<br /><br />
> Thank you so much for reading, understanding, and for the support.


### Reasoning behind all this...

_`Why though?`_ My country, **(Lebanon)** is currently going through a bad economic & political crisis. In light of the current situation, maintaining the project, or at least any extra ones, pro-bono, is getting harder than it should be. Your contributions will go a long way into sustaining it for a long time to come.

As a person who loves `Linux`, I share those things with you, So you can take _inspiration_ and try to create your own, So that you can **learn**. Not because I want an audience to buy my stuff. I don't like to do that, but due to current situation, without a job to feed myself, or pay the outstanding monthly bills, I have no choice.

It's not like I do not offer a free way to grab this and any future projects I work on. Either support me to get a pre-built ISO by either donating either once or monthly by joining any of the available Tiers on my [**Ko-Fi**](https://ko-fi.com/xerolinux) or any of my other Services on main page. Or get it for **FREE** by following a simple guide I have painstakingly put together. Simple as that.

All the funds I get from this, Will eventually be invested towards making **[XeroLinux](https://xerolinux.xyz/)** support a wider rage of hardware. I maintain this project all by myself with code contributions by my good friends [**@keyaedisa**](https://keyaedisa.github.io/) for the **ABS** ISO build tool & [**@dedSyn4ps3**](https://github.com/dedsyn4ps3) for **Xero Hello** app, and many others I cannot list here.

### Also, Why should I not charge?

Let me tell you why... I'm a `KDE Plasma` user, I have been using it for almost 3 years till date. I don't use anything else. But I have created this and will make others in the future *as you keep asking me* to, **`Kind of demanded`**. Like do this and do that.

I understand, there are many other and in most cases better and **Free** choices out there. But you came here for a reason. You like my work. Also consider that I am a one man show, not a _Company_ with a huge team and income or contributions from the likes of **Microsoft** / **Redhat** or others. I need to sustain myself and my projects...

**- Consider this...**

Let me be clear, I am not as well known as many other projects out there. As a result I am not getting as many downloads as I would hope. With that in mind...

**FOSS** doesn't mean `FREE OF COST`. It means **`Freedom`** of choice. So you're free to choose either my distro or any other one. You can even grab **XeroLinux** and shape it the way you want, without any limits..

> **`Yes, I'm a FOSS maintainer and I charge for my time, work and efforts. That's it.`**

Thank you for understanding. I don't mean to be harsh, but unfortunately that's the reality, and it can be hard at times.
